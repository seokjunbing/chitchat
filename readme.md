chitchat is a location based board for people to post their thoughts and read othersâ€™.
All posts are filtered based on the user's current location (50km radius).


## User Interactions
Upon sign-in or sign-up, the message board screen is shown. This board contains messages that are 
filtered based on the user's current location. The user has a choice of upvoting or downvoting 
the posts (a user can only upvote or downvote a post once). A user can reply to others' posts: if the user clicks a post, they are taken to 
the replies screen. The replies screen shows all the replies attached to the post. A user can then
add their own reply to the post or upvote/downvote other replies.

Swipe down on the feed to refresh.
